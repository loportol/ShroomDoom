Shroom Doom was created with Unity and C#. Shroom Doom is a puzzle platformer where the player plays as a small mushroom guy who has the ability to infect NPC characters around them and control their movements. This game was completely created by myself, including most character art.

This repo contains the script folder of the project Unity as an example.
